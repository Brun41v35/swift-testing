/// A type that allows transforming or filtering the issues recorded by a test.
///
/// Use this type to observe or customize the issue(s) recorded by the test this
/// trait is applied to. You can transform a recorded issue by copying it,
/// modifying one or more of its properties, and returning the copy. You can
/// observe recorded issues by returning them unmodified. Or you can suppress an
/// issue by either filtering it using ``Trait/filterIssues(_:)`` or returning
/// `nil` from the closure passed to ``Trait/compactMapIssues(_:)``.
///
/// When an instance of this trait is applied to a suite, it is recursively
/// inherited by all child suites and tests.
///
/// To add this trait to a test, use one of the following functions:
///
/// - ``Trait/compactMapIssues(_:)``
/// - ``Trait/filterIssues(_:)``
///
